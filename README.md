Classy CMS is a content management system built to free web designers from the shackles of templates with its intuitive features and its ease of use. It's powered by Bootstrap and TinyMCE. It only uses php and javascript so any apache server can handle this system. It was imagined June of 2012 and first implemented May of 2013. New versions are still being worked on and emails will be sent when updates are released.


Note: Documentation will be released with Version 1. Beta does not have documentation as it is still in development.
